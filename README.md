# ATLAS
Graph Analysis Project

Due to high blood pressure and anxiety attacks, I have been sick for the past 2 days of this commit and haven't turned in some files and the paper reading task video. Will do that in the early morning hours of 11th February. I have put very serious amount of effort in performing these analytic tasks and do not want to submit incomplete work which reflects badly. Hope that is not an issue. Kindly take a look at my .pdf report file named as Precog Recruitment in the meanwhile. All files in a structured manner would be up by 11th morning. Apologies for the inconvenience.
