# ATLAS
Graph Analysis Project

I apologize for the structure of files in this repo as even moving them around would cost a commit and it's already post-deadline. 
But I'll walk through it. The TASK 2 folder contains the files relevant to the task with the implementation of community detection algorithms.
Task-1, Paper reading task, and bonus task folders are empty. Kindly ignore them. All the other .py files are the ones I used for TASK 1. They mostly contain
scraping, generative, and plotting code I used throughout my report. Kindly ignore all .pdf files in the repository. The REPORT with the drive link below
is the heart and soul of the work that I did for this ATLAS task. Everything of real "value" for the programming task is contained within this Programming task report drive link.
I couldn't attempt the bonus task due to time constraints but developed intuitions after reading the paper which I'll be happy to share if I get to the next level :)
